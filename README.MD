# Thoughts and Observations on the WaveShare 
# [ESP32-S3-SIM7670G-4G](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-SIM7670G-4G)

Having bought this board, I found that the documentation was lacking critical information and the demo software had bugs.

The aim of this is to share the observations with others and eventually with Waveshare so that others can bebfit from the work done.
